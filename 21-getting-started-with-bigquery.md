# 21. Getting starte with BigQuery

We will stream our App Engine logs into BigQuery and query the data.

We will use the App Engine project created in [#14](14-getting-started-with-app-engine.md) to store queries.

## Setup Cloud Logging

1. Confirm that you have a running instance of your app at [App Engine](https://console.cloud.google.com/appengine)
2. Visit [Cloud Logging](https://console.cloud.google.com/logs) and select your currently running application
3. Click 'Create Export' to create a dataset to write to
    1. Add a meaningful name
    2. Select 'BigQuery' for sink service
    3. Create a sink destination (or select one if already created)
    4. Create sink
4. Visit [Exports](https://console.cloud.google.com/logs/exports) from the sidebar

## Making queries

1. Visit [BigQuery](https://bigquery.cloud.google.com/) where the dataset should be visible (you may need to select the correct project)
2. Create a few requests in your application
3. Back in BigQuery, click on the table generated by Google below the export name in the sidebar
4. In the table details click a few fields (only leaf nodes can be selected for the query) and make the query

### Make a custom query

1. Get the top 10 requests ordered by latency

    ```sql
    SELECT protoPayload.resource, protoPayload.latency
    FROM <your-table-id>
    ORDER BY protoPayload.latency DESC
    LIMIT 10
    ```
2. Get all status codes and the number of times those status codes were returned in a request:

    ```sql
    SELECT
      protoPayload.status,
      COUNT(protoPayload.status) AS COUNT
    FROM
      [<table-di>]
    ORDER BY
      protoPayload.latency DESC
    GROUP BY
      protoPayload.status
    ```
    
## Cleanup

1. Under [Log Exports](https://console.cloud.google.com/logs/exports) delete the export
2. In [BigQuery](https://bigquery.cloud.google.com/) delete your dataset
